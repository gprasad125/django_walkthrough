## 🤔 Purpose

This is a repository containing materials for the Django Project Walkthrough @ [AI Camp](ai-camp.org).

If you are here from AI Camp, you can reach the crash course [here](https://www.notion.so/Django-Project-Walkthrough-0cf5b67991f04b6a984c094f31209a62)

## 🧠 Explanation

This repository contains a very basic summarization app, meant as a tutorial in developing Django models, views, and pathways. 

This is **not** a comprehensive covering of all of Django's capabilities, and I encourage you to continue tinkering and exploring once you have completed the crash course! This is primarily meant to be an introduction for those with little to no experience working in a Django framework. 😁
